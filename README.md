# Elevator-Controller
A multithreaded program which simulates passengers and elevator travel.
A M story highrise has N elevators in a single “elevator bank”, each able to serve every floor of the building. 
Contrary from most elevator designs, there are no buttons to choose a destination floor inside the elevator.
Instead, the elevator lobby at each floor has M individual “destination floor” buttons, and passengers choose their destination by pushing the appropriate button. 
Once a button is pushed, a display near the buttons tells the passenger which elevator door to wait by. 


This project creates an elevator controller that ensures that all passengers receive service, minimizing the mean and max time between button push and arrival at the destination floor.
